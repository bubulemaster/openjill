Creative Music CMF to Standard MIDI
Posted by Alex on Sat, 04/24/1999 - 14:06.
CMF2MID is great and easy to use, but if you want
to convert 100 CMFs...
Soundcard differences described by Adam Mirowski
(CMF2MID author) are not so important for WaveTable,
and general conversion scheme can be created. This
assumes that all you need to run batch converting is
CMF2MID + simple software that can read data from
conversion table to create CMM files automatically
(one need few minutes to write it) + conversion table
itself. However, the last should have thousands of
items (how many instruments do they use in CMF?).
So, if you can send me your CMM files - send them!
Please note: I don't need tons of CMFs - all I ask is
text CMMs (if you don't know what it is - don't send
anything).
Thanks.
