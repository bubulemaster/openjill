====== History ======

In 2011 a co-worker show me a game works under Android platform that he write. He say me "That is the futur ! Forget Delphi.".\\ 
Yes, it's true. In my spare time, I wrote some program in Delphi.\\  
He makes fun of me because Delphi is old technologie (but not death !).\\ 
I say "Ok, let me show that I can create a plateform game in Delphi from scratch without any help."
One year later, I show [[http://www.openjill.org/other/tnc/|The Nuclear Caves]] game, a clone of "Crystal Caves" game, but wrote in Lazarus (a clone of Delphi).\\ 
The only problem is that the game store map level in own MS-DOS executable, I must recreate all graphic item. It's very long and I dislike this.

In summer of 2012, I discover the [[http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki|Modding Wiki]] website with many thing about the "Jill trilogy" game".

I remember this game that took me long hour when I'm young.
OpenJill project was born.

I decide to use Java plateform for this project cause I'm JEE developper and I never use GUI library like AWT or Swing.
