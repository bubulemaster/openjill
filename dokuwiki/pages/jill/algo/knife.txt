====== Knife movement ======

Knife is first weapon in Jill Trilogy, but his movement is a little bit complicated.

//iStateCount// is state of object.\\
//iXD// is the size of current move and way (>0 to right, 0> to left).\\
//iYD// is the size of current move and way (only 0, -1, 1)

===== No move =====

//iStateCount// = 0 to no move.

===== Fall =====

//iStateCount// = 65535 to fall but no other verticaly move. iYd = -1

===== Launch (fire key pressed) =====
When player fire, knife is create at X = player.X and Y = player.Y+2.\\
iStateCount set to 1.\\
iXd = 8 or -8 (depend of iXd of player)

===== State and action =====

^iStatCount^iXd^iYd^Behavior^
|0|0|0| no move, no fall, no hit ennemy. Player can catch it. |
| 1 -> 14|8 or -8|0| hit enemeny. Player can't catch it.\\ Add iXd at each cycle |
| 14 -> 64|8 -> -8|4 -> -4| hit enemeny. Knife follow player (see below). |
| 65535 |0|-1| hit enemeny. Knife fall. Player can catch it |

===== Knife follow player =====

The goal is to goto player.X and player.Y.\\
If player.X is greater than X and iXd < 8, increase iXd to 1.\\
If player.X is smaller than X and iXd > -8, decrease iXd to 1.\\
If player.Y is greater than Y and iYd < 4, increase iXd to 1.\\
If player.Y is smaller than Y and iYd > -4, decrease iXd to 1.

Atfer, just add to X iXd and to Y iYd.
